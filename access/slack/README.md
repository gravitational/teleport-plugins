# slack

This package implements a simple Slack plugin using the API provided in the
[`access`](../) package which allows Access Requests to be approved/denied via
interactive Slack messages.

## Setup

[See setup instructions on Teleport's website](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/enterprise/workflow/ssh_approval_slack/)

Run `make access-slack && ./access/slack/build/teleport-slack configure` from
the repository root. The `configure` command will produce an example
configuration file that looks something like this:

```toml
# example slack plugin configuration TOML file
[teleport]
auth_server = "example.com:3025"                         # Teleport Auth Server GRPC API address
client_key = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack/auth.key"  # Teleport GRPC client secret key
client_crt = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack/auth.crt"  # Teleport GRPC client certificate
root_cas = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack/auth.cas"    # Teleport cluster CA certs

[slack]
token = "api-token"         # Slack Bot OAuth token
secret = "secret-value"     # Slack API Signing Secret
channel = "channel-name"    # Message delivery channel

[http]
# listen_addr = ":8081" # Network address in format [addr]:port on which callback server listens, e.g. 0.0.0.0:443
https_key_file = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack/server.key"  # TLS private key
https_cert_file = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack/server.crt" # TLS certificate

[log]
output = "stderr" # Logger output. Could be "stdout", "stderr" or "/var/lib/teleport/slack.log"
severity = "INFO" # Logger severity. Could be "INFO", "ERROR", "DEBUG" or "WARN".
```

Detailed install steps are provided within the [`install`](INSTALL.md)
instructions.

### `[teleport]`

This configuration section ensures that the bot can talk to your teleport auth
server & manage access-requests. Use `tctl auth sign --format=tls` to generate
the required PEM files, and make sure that the Auth Server's GRPC API is
accessible at the address indicated by `auth_server`.

_NOTE_: The slack plugin must be given a teleport user identity with appropriate
permissions. See the [acccess package README](../README.md#authentication) for
an example of how to configure an appropriate user & role.

### `[slack]`

In order to interact with slack, we need a valid bot OAuth token and we need to
be able to receive callbacks from slack when users interact with messages.

A token can be provisioned from [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com) by
registering an App and associated Bot User for your workspace.

In order to receive interaction callbacks, make sure the `host` address is
publicly accessible and register it with your App under
`Features > Interactive Components > Request URL`.

_NOTE_: For debug purposes, slack recommends using `ngrok http` to get a public
HTTPS endpoint for your interaction callback. You must also use
`--insecure-no-tls` option when running Slackbot under `ngrok`.

## Usage

Once your Slack plugin has been configured, you can verify that it is working
correctly by using `tctl request create <user> --roles=<roles>` to simulate an
access request. If everything is working as intended, a message with `Approve`
and `Deny` buttons should appear in the channel specified under `slack.channel`.
Select `Deny` and verify that the request was indeed denied using
`tctl request ls`.

## Security

Currently, this Bot does not make any distinction about _who_ approves/denies a
request. Any user with access to the specified channel will be able to manage
requests. Therefore, it is important that access to the channel be limited.
