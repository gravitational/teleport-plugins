### Access API

The Teleport Access API has been moved into the main Teleport repo, and can be imported from `github.com/gravitational/teleport/api`. To see examples of how to get started with the Teleport API, take a look at our [go-client example](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/examples/go-client) or read the [API docs](https://goteleport.com/docs/api/introduction/).

For more specific examples of how to manage workflows with the Teleport API, take a look at the [workflows example](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/examples/workflows).
