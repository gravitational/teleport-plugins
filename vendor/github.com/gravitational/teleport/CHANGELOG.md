# Changelog

### 4.4.4

This release of Teleport adds enhancements to the Access Workflows API.

* Support for creating limited roles that trigger access requests
on login, allowing users to be configured such that no nodes can
be accessed without externally granted roles.

* Teleport UI support for automatically generating access requests and
assuming new roles upon approval (access requests were previously
only available in `tsh`).

* New `claims_to_roles` mapping that can use claims from external
identity providers to determine which roles a user can request.

* Various minor API improvements to help make requests easier to
manage and audit, including support for human-readable
request/approve/deny reasons and structured annotations.

### 4.4.2

This release of Teleport adds support for a new build architecture.

* Added automatic arm64 builds of Teleport to the download portal.

### 4.4.1

This release of Teleport contains a bug fix.

* Fixed an issue where defining multiple logging configurations would cause Teleport to crash. [#4598](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4598)

### 4.4.0

This is a major Teleport release with a focus on new features, functionality, and bug fixes. It’s a substantial release and users can review [4.3 closed issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/40?closed=1) on Github for details of all items.

#### New Features

##### Concurrent Session Control

This addition to Teleport helps customers obtain AC-10 control. We now provide two new optional configuration values: `max_connections` and `max_sessions`.

###### `max_connections`

This value is the total number of concurrent sessions within a cluster to nodes running Teleport. This value is applied at a per user level. If you set `max_connections` to 1, a `tsh` user would only be able to `tsh ssh` into one node at a time.

###### `max_sessions` per connection

This value limits the total number of session channels which can be established across a single SSH connection (typically used for interactive terminals or remote exec operations). This is for cases where nodes have Teleport set up, but a user is using OpenSSH to connect to them. It is essentially equivalent to the `MaxSessions` configuration value accepted by `sshd`.

```yaml
spec:
  options:
    # Optional: Required to be set for AC-10 Compliance
    max_connections: 2
    # Optional: To match OpenSSH behavior set to 10
    max_sessions: 10
```

###### `session_control_timeout`

A new `session_control_timeout` configuration value has been added to the `auth_service` configuration block of the Teleport config file. It's unlikely that you'll need to modify this.

```yaml
auth_service:
  session_control_timeout: 2m # default
# ...
```

#### Session Streaming Improvements

Teleport 4.4 includes a complete refactoring of our event system. This resolved a few customer bug reports such as [#3800: Events overwritten in DynamoDB](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3800) and [#3182: Teleport consuming all disk space with multipart uploads](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3182).

Along with foundational improvements, 4.4 includes two new experimental `session_recording` options: `node-sync` and `proxy-sync`.
NOTE: These experimental modes require all Teleport auth servers, proxy servers and nodes to be running Teleport 4.4.

```yaml
# This section configures the 'auth service':
auth_service:
    # Optional setting for configuring session recording. Possible values are:
    #     "node"  : sessions will be recorded on the node level (the default)
    #     "proxy" : recording on the proxy level, see "recording proxy mode" section.
    #     "off"   : session recording is turned off
    #
    #     EXPERIMENTAL *-sync modes: proxy and node send logs directly to S3 or other
    #     storage without storing the records on disk at all. This mode will kill a
    #     connection if network connectivity is lost.
    #     NOTE: These experimental modes require all Teleport auth servers, proxy servers and
    #     nodes to be running Teleport 4.4.
    #
    #     "node-sync" : sessions recording will be streamed from node -> auth -> storage
    #     "proxy-sync : sessions recording will be streamed from proxy -> auth -> storage
    #
    session_recording: "node-sync"
```

#### Upgrade Notes

Please follow our [standard upgrade procedure](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport).

## 4.3.7

This release of Teleport contains a security fix and a bug fix.

* Mitigated [CVE-2020-15216](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15216) by updating github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig.

### Details
A vulnerability was discovered in the `github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig` library which is used by Teleport to validate the
signatures of XML files used to configure SAML 2.0 connectors. With a carefully crafted XML file, an attacker can completely
bypass XML signature validation and pass off an altered file as a signed one.

### Actions
The `goxmldsig` library has been updated upstream and Teleport 4.3.7 includes the fix. Any Enterprise SSO users using Okta,
Active Directory, OneLogin or custom SAML connectors should upgrade their auth servers to version 4.3.7 and restart Teleport.

If you are unable to upgrade immediately, we suggest deleting SAML connectors for all clusters until the updates can be applied.

Teleport 4.3 includes a completely redesigned Web UI. The new Web UI expands the management functionality of a Teleport cluster and the user experience of using Teleport to make it easier and simpler to use. Teleport's new terminal provides a quick jumping-off point to access nodes and nodes on other clusters via the web.

Teleport's Web UI now exposes Teleport’s Audit log, letting auditors and administrators view Teleport access events, SSH events, recording session, and enhanced session recording all in one view.

##### Teleport Plugins

Teleport 4.3 introduces four new plugins that work out of the box with [Approval Workflow](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/enterprise/workflow/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=4_3). These plugins allow you to automatically support role escalation with commonly used third party services. The built-in plugins are listed below.

#### Upgrade Notes

Always follow the [recommended upgrade procedure](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport?utm_source=github&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=4_3) to upgrade to this version.

##### New Signing Algorithm

If you’re upgrading an existing version of Teleport, you may want to consider rotating CA to SHA-256 or SHA-512 for RSA SSH certificate signatures. The previous default was SHA-1, which is now considered to be weak against brute-force attacks. SHA-1 certificate signatures are also [no longer accepted](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html) by OpenSSH versions 8.2 and above. All new Teleport clusters will default to SHA-512 based signatures. To upgrade an existing cluster, set the following in your `teleport.yaml`:

```
teleport:
    ca_signature_algo: "rsa-sha2-512"
```

Rotate the cluster CA, following [these docs](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#certificate-rotation?utm_source=github&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=4_3).

##### Web UI

Due to the number of changes included in the redesigned Web UI, some URLs and functionality have shifted. Refer to the following ticket for more details. [#3580](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3580)

##### RBAC for Audit Log and Recorded Sessions

Teleport 4.3 has made the audit log accessible via the Web UI. Enterprise customers
can limit access by changing the options on the new `event` resource.

```yaml
# list and read audit log, including audit events and recorded sessions
- resources: [event]
  verbs: [list, read]
```

##### Kubernetes Permissions

The minimum set of Kubernetes permissions that need to be granted to Teleport proxies has been updated. If you use the Kubernetes integration, please make sure that the ClusterRole used by the proxy has [sufficient permissions](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/kubernetes_ssh#impersonation).

##### Path prefix for etcd

The [etcd backend](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#using-etcd) now correctly uses the “prefix” config value when storing data. Upgrading from 4.2 to 4.3 will migrate the data as needed at startup. Make sure you follow our Teleport [upgrade guidance](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport).

**Note: If you use an etcd backend with a non-default prefix and need to downgrade from 4.3 to 4.2, you should [backup Teleport data and restore it](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#backing-up-teleport) into the downgraded cluster.**

## 4.2.7

As part of a routine security audit of Teleport, a security vulnerability was discovered that affects all recent releases of Teleport. We strongly suggest upgrading to the latest patched release to mitigate this vulnerability.

### Details

Due to a flaw in how the Teleport Web UI handled host certificate validation, host certificate validation was disabled for clusters where connections were terminated at the node. This means that an attacker could impersonate a Teleport node without detection when connecting through the Web UI.

Clusters where sessions were terminated at the proxy (recording proxy mode) are not affected.

Command line programs like `tsh` (or `ssh`) are not affected by this vulnerability.

### Actions

To mitigate this issue, upgrade and restart all Teleport proxy processes.

## 4.0.16

As part of a routine security audit of Teleport, a security vulnerability was discovered that affects all recent releases of Teleport. We strongly suggest upgrading to the latest patched release to mitigate this vulnerability.

### Details

Due to a flaw in how the Teleport Web UI handled host certificate validation, host certificate validation was disabled for clusters where connections were terminated at the node. This means that an attacker could impersonate a Teleport node without detection when connecting through the Web UI.

Clusters where sessions were terminated at the proxy (recording proxy mode) are not affected.

Command line programs like `tsh` (or `ssh`) are not affected by this vulnerability.

### Actions

To mitigate this issue, upgrade and restart all Teleport proxy processes.

## 4.0.0

This is a major Teleport release which introduces support for Teleport Internet of Things (IoT). In addition to this new feature this release includes usability, performance, and bug fixes listed below.

## New Features

### Teleport for IoT

With Teleport 4.0, nodes gain the ability to use reverse tunnels to dial back to a Teleport cluster to bypass firewall restrictions. This allows connections even to nodes that a cluster does not have direct network access to. Customers that have been using Trusted Clusters to achieve this can now utilize a unified interface to access all nodes within their infrastructure.

### FedRamp Compliance

With this release of Teleport, we have built out the foundation to help Teleport Enterprise customers build and meet the requirements in a FedRAMP System Security Plan (SSP). This includes a FIPS 140-2 friendly build of Teleport Enterprise as well as a variety of improvements to aid in complying with security controls even in FedRAMP High environments.

## Improvements

* Teleport now support 10,000 remote connections to a single Teleport cluster. [Using our recommend hardware setup.](https://gravitational.com/teleport/faq/#whats-teleport-scalability-and-hardware-recommendations)
* Added ability to delete node using `tctl rm`. [#2685](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2685)
* Output of `tsh ls` is now sorted by node name. [#2534](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2534)

## Bug Fixes

* Switched to `xdg-open` to open a browser window on Linux. [#2536](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2536)
* Increased SSO callback timeout to 180 seconds. [#2533](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2533)
* Set permissions on TTY similar to OpenSSH. [#2508](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2508)

The lists of improvements and bug fixes above mention only the significant changes, please take a look at the complete list on Github for more.

## Upgrading

Teleport 4.0 is backwards compatible with Teleport 3.2 and later. [Follow the recommended upgrade procedure to upgrade to this version.](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport)

Note that due to substantial changes between Teleport 3.2 and 4.0, we recommend creating a backup of the backend datastore (DynamoDB, etcd, or dir) before upgrading a cluster to Teleport 4.0 to allow downgrades.

### Notes on compatibility

Teleport has always validated host certificates when a client connects to a server, however prior to Teleport 4.0, Teleport did not validate the host the user requests a connection to is in the list of principals on the certificate. To ensure a seamless upgrade, make sure the hosts you connect to have the appropriate address set in `public_addr` in `teleport.yaml` before upgrading.

## 2.6.0

This release of Teleport brings new features, significant performance and
usability improvements as well usual bugfixes.

During this release cycle, the Teleport source code has been audited for
security vulnerabilities by Cure53 and this release (2.6.0) contains patches
for the discovered problems.

#### New Features

* Support for DynamoDB for storing the audit log events. [#1755](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1755)
* Support for Amazon S3 for storing the recorded SSH sessions. [#1755](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1755)
* Support for rotating certificate authorities (CA rotation). [#1899] (https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/1899)
* Integration with Linux PAM (pluggable authentication modules) subsystem. [#742](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/742) and [#1766](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1766)
* The new CLI command `tsh status` shows users which Teleport clusters they are authenticated with. [#1628](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1628)

Additionally, Teleport 2.6.0 has been submitted to the AWS marketplace. Soon
AWS users will be able to create properly configured, secure and highly
available Teleport clusters with ease.

#### Configuration Changes

* Role templates (depreciated in Teleport 2.3) were fully removed. We recommend
  migrating to role variables which are documented [here](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/ssh_rbac/#roles)

* Resource names (like roles, connectors, trusted clusters) can no longer
  contain unicode or other special characters. Update the names of all user
  created resources to only include characters, hyphens, and dots.

* `advertise_ip` has been deprecated and replaced with `public_addr` setting. See [#1803](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1803)
  The existing configuration files will still work, but we advise Teleport
  administrators to update it to reflect the new format.

* Teleport no longer uses `boltdb` back-end for storing cluster state _by
  default_.  The new default is called `dir` and it uses simple JSON files
  stored in `/var/lib/teleport/backend`. This change applies to brand new
  Teleport installations, the existing clusters will continue to use `boltdb`.

* The default set of enabled cryptographic primitives has been
  updated to reflect the latest state of SSH and TLS security. [#1856](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1856).

#### Bug Fixes

The list of most visible bug fixes in this release:

* `tsh` now properly handles Ctrl+C [#1882](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1882)
* High CPU utilization on ARM platforms during daemon start-up. [#1886](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1886)
* Terminal window size can get out of sync on AWS. [#1874](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1874)
* Some CLI commands print errors twice. [#1889](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1889)
* SSH session playback can be interrupted for long sessions. [#1774](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1774)
* Processing `HUP` UNIX signal is unreliable when `teleport` daemon runs under `systemd`. [#1844](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1844)

#### Bug Fixes

* Binaries for macOS have been rebuilt to resolve "certificate signed by a unknown authority" issue.

## 2.5.0

This is a major release of Teleport. Its goal is to make cloud-native
deployments easier. Numerous AWS users have contributed feedback to this
release, which includes:

#### New Features

* Auth servers in highly available (HA) configuration can share the same `/var/lib/teleport`
  data directory when it's hosted on NFS (or AWS EFS).
  [#1351](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1351)

* There is now an AWS reference deployment in `examples/aws` directory.  It
  uses Terraform and demonstrates how to deploy large Teleport clusters on AWS
  using best practices like auto-scaling groups, security groups, secrets
  management, load balancers, etc.

* The Teleport daemon now implements built-in connection draining which allows
  zero-downtime upgrades.
  [See documentation](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#graceful-restarts).

* Dynamic join tokens for new nodes can now be explicitly set via `tctl node add --token`.
  This allows Teleport admins to use an external mechanism for generating
  cluster invitation tokens.
  [#1615](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/1615)

* Teleport now correctly manages certificates for accessing proxies behind a
  load balancer with the same domain name. The new configuration parameter
  `public_addr` must be used for this.
  [#1174](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1174).

#### Improvements

* Switching to a new TLS-based auth server API improves performance of large clusters.
  [#1528](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1528)

* Session recordings are now compressed by default using gzip. This reduces storage
  requirements by up to 80% in our real-world tests.
  [#1579](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1528)

* More user-friendly authentication errors in Teleport audit log helps Teleport admins
  troubleshoot configuration errors when integrating with SAML/OIDC providers.
  [#1554](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1554),
  [#1553](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1553),
  [#1599](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1599)

* `tsh` client will now report if a server's API is no longer compatible.

#### Bug Fixes

* `tsh logout` will now correctly log out from all active Teleport sessions. This is useful
  for users who're connected to multiple Teleport clusters at the same time.
  [#1541](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1541)

* When parsing YAML, Teleport now supports `--` list item separator to create
  multiple resources with a single `tctl create` command.
  [#1663](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1663)

* Fixed a panic in the Web UI backend [#1558](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1558)

#### Behavior Changes

Certain components of Teleport behave differently in version 2.5. It is important to
note that these changes are not breaking Teleport functionality. They improve
Teleport behavior on large clusters deployed on highly dynamic cloud
environments such as AWS. This includes:

* Session list in the Web UI is now limited to 1,000 sessions.
* The audit log and recorded session storage has been moved from `/var/lib/teleport/log`
  to `/var/lib/teleport/log/<auth-server-id>`. This is related to [#1351](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1351)
  described above.
* When connecting a trusted cluster users can no longer pick an arbitrary name for them.
  Their own (local) names will be used, i.e. the `cluster_name` setting now defines how
  the cluster is seen from the outside.
  [#1543](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1543)

## 2.0.5

Teleport 2.0.5 contains a variety of security fixes. We strongly encourage anyone running Teleport 2.0.0 and above to upgrade to 2.0.5.

The most pressing issues (a phishing attack which can potentially be used to extract plaintext credentials and an attack where an already authenticated user can escalate privileges) can be resolved by upgrading the web proxy. However, however all nodes need to be upgraded to mitigate all vulnerabilities.

### Bugfixes

* Patch for TLP-01-001 and TLP-01-003: Check redirect.
* Patch for TLP-01-004: Always check is namespace is valid.
* Patch for TLP-01-005: Check user principal when joining session.
* Patch for TLP-01-006 and TLP-01-007: Validate Session ID.
* Patch for TLP-01-008: Use a fake hash for password authentication if user does not exist.
* Patch for TLP-01-009: Command injection in scp.

## 2.0.4

### Bugfixes

* Roles created the the Web UI now have `node` resource. [#949](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/949)

## 2.0.3
