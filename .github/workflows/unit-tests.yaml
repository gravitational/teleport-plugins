# This test exists to ensure that we don't break compatibility of the event handler
# when we merge the unstructured events support.
# This is a temporary test and should be removed in Teleport 14.
# Since unstructured events API was intoduced in 13.1.0, this test fallbacks to
# the old SearchEvents and StreamSessionIDEvents API and should be able to complete
# without errors.
# DELETE IN 14.0.0
